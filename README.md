list of random ideas for open source stuff

1. Proper heatmap website analytics - easy to install and easy to hook up with MongoDB or another backend (maybe through a key-value interface); simple enough API to do clever stuff with and modify the data
2. a module like [WebChimera.js](http://webchimera.org), but directly on top of libav - maybe WebChimera.js 2.0 ?
3. ionic-like framework for the desktop, again built on Angular
4. ad platform that only serves a logo, which can be used as a non-intrusive watermark over a video, or in some UI design, again non-intrusively
6. Something with https://github.com/Plaristote/qmlweb
7. [Pure JS based video player](/js-player.md) that can polyfill webm/mp4 containers and the most common video/audio codecs, so it can play any popular video format regardless of the browser 


list of ideas which I have more or less realized

1. [playback-native](http://github.com/Ivshti/playback-native): performance oriented video player in JS - uses WebChimera.js tied together with tint2; uses native VLC vouts to draw the video; currently in alpha
2. Filmon.tv addon for Stremio
