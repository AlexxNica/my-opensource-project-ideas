# my-opensource-project-ideas
list of random ideas for open source stuff

* #1 - Proper heatmap website analytics - easy to install and easy to hook up with MongoDB or another backend (maybe through a key-value interface); simple enough API to do clever stuff with and modify the data
* #2 - a module like [WebChimera.js](http://webchimera.org), but directly on top of libav - maybe WebChimera.js 2.0 ?
* #3 - ionic-like framework for the desktop, again built on Angular
* #4 - ad platform that only serves a logo, which can be used as a non-intrusive watermark over a video, or in some UI design, again non-intrusively
